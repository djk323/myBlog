 What is it like being the first to grow up seeing the overwhelming weight of all of world’s perfections and imperfections every day? The first generation to hold the power of the internet in our hands from a young age. What is it like to see thousands of edited “role models” every day…influencers whose perfection becomes the new average? The inconceivable average that we have strived for and not accomplished since the mere age of 14. What is it like being exposed to the constant glorification of eating disorders and negative mental health? What is it like when our lines between reality and the internet are blurred, when the lines between truth and manipulation are impossible to see… when the destination becomes more for the photos instead of the experience? As the youngest, up-and-coming generation of today, we will be the only ones who fully understand the struggles technology has brought us. Out of 33 teen responses, 22 say the most toxic part of social media is the constant comparison of themselves to unrealistic body and life standards.

     My blog works to bring the unique challenges that generation z (and now all generations) struggles with to light through firsthand experience, and to help others open their eyes to the hold technology has on us. We must create discussions on how to teach the younger generation to handle the growing addictiveness of social media, but first we must become self-aware and better our own generation instead of suffocating it. As an ELA and SS middle school educator, I will include some discussions and observations of my students, from this year and student teaching years. I will never name the school or students, as the qualitative data I observe is only to give others insight into the war going on in our schools, in our children’s minds, in our own minds, and in our homes. I will also share resources for educators and students to combat social media misuse.
